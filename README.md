# Tech Trybe Sparkling Gala 2025 Ticket Generator

This project is a web-based ticket generator for the Tech Trybe Sparkling Gala 2025 event. Users can:
- Upload an avatar image.
- Enter their full name and nickname.
- Provide their email address.
- Select their level type (Graduate or Undergraduate, with additional selection for undergraduate levels).
- Indicate if they will be attending Thanksgiving.

Once submitted, the form data is used to generate a stylized ticket that is displayed on-screen. The form is then hidden for a clean view of the ticket. A screenshot of the ticket (including CSS styling) is captured and provided as a downloadable PNG image. The ticket details are also sent to a backend (Google Apps Script) for storage in a Google Sheet.
